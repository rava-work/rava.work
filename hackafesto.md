Welcome to rava.work, where creators unite! We're a global community of indie-makers, developers, designers, and hackers, all building our own dreams. Every Thursday, join us to innovate, collaborate, and celebrate the spirit of indie-making.

- Morning Kickoff (9-10am): Start your day with introductions. Share who you are, what you're working on, and your goals for the day. Commit to demoing your progress and let's keep each other accountable.
- Lunchtime Connections: Gather for an informal lunch. It's the perfect moment to exchange ideas and make new friends while fueling up for the afternoon.
- Afternoon Demos (3-5pm): Showcase your creations! Receive valuable feedback on design, functionality, and more. This is your chance to shine and inspire others while holding yourself to your commitments.
- Evening Meetups: Wind down with optional drinks or dinner. Celebrate the day’s achievements and forge lasting connections.
