# How to start a new Rava Node

Starting a new Rava Node is a great way to bring together indie-makers, developers, and creators in your area. But we would like you to follow some guidelines.

Follow the steps below to establish your own Node as part of the global Rava network.

## 1. The Rava spirit

First, dive into the ravafesto (our manifesto). Our community is very much tech-first and all about building apps, products and startups. Coding your own product or app is at the heart of what we do. There is always space for the other (very important) pieces that go into building a successful product, such as marketing, sales, etc, but the core is in development/coding. 

Regarding the rhythm/schedule in the ravafesto: feel free to adapt the schedule to best fit your Node's needs, but please keep the individual components intact. They are the essence of Rava and a proven concept :)

## 2. Connect with the global network

If you like what you read in the ravafesto, the next step is to reach out to the Rava network organizers to assist with setting up your Telegram group, Node website, and any other resources you might need. 

We're here to help you and ensure you have the necessary support for a successful Node launch!

## 3. Choose a suitable location

Securing a good location is pretty important. A co-working space or office are amongst the best locations. You will be working throughout the day together and wouldn't want to be distracted, right? 

We advise to avoid highly public places to maintain a focused environment. The venue should support collaborative working and be able to faciliate the introductions, lunch,  demos, and breakout conversations if individual members want to discuss anything more deeply.

In particular for the demos, it's vital to have a projector/screen or large TV and necessary cables and equipment for members to give demos. Meeting rooms are generally good for this. Make sure that it's also sufficiently big so everyone fits. We have first-hand experience with this challenge, which is why we mention it here ;)

## 4. Establish your Node's presence

Create a dedicated website for your Node using the provided template (we let you know how to when you contact us, which, at this stage, you've already done).

Keep public/online promotion minimal to maintain the Node's culture and values (again, we have experience with this, it's the best approach generally). Carefully considering these will help to grow slow, stable and steadily and will help you with sticking to our ravafesto. 
It's best to invite people 1-on-1 if you feel like they're a good fit. Public promotions should be rare and carefully considered to maintain our culture. 

During step 2 we'll also explain this, but we need you to establish a Telegram group to facilitate communication within your community. This is one of the most essential parts.

## 5. Set a consistent schedule

Plan your Node's weekly Monday meetups with morning introductions, an informal lunch, afternoon demos, and optional evening activities. 
Consistency helps build a reliable community rhythm, so it's best to decide beforehand and stick to your own schedule/timing.

## 6. Host the first Meetup

First of all, have fun! In the mornings, start with introductions and encourage members to not just introduce themselves, but also share about their companies, projects and goals. 

Prepare the afternoon demo session to ensure everything is ready to go and facilitate it by asking who has a demo at first, setting a maximum time (we suggest 4 to 8 minutes, depending on the amount of demos), and ask who wants to go first. It'll sort itself out afterwards :)!

## 7. Commit to it long-term

Dedicate yourself to the ongoing management of your Node, by making sure both the venue and weekly meetups are consistently organized. 
As you grow, it should naturally begin to self-organize â€“ this is part of the hacker spirit :)

By following these steps, you can successfully launch a Rava Node, creating a vibrant community of innovators and independent creators in your area. Hurray! Welcome to the network!
